<h2> <u> About me </u> </h2>
 <p>I like working out, cooking, cats, eating, fashion stuff and music.</p>
<h3> <u> Working Out </u> </h3>

 <p>I usually go to gym 4 times per week. Eventhough I am busy sometimes, I try to go to gym 2 times per week. It is my way to relax when I do the weights it makes me calm down.</p>
 <p>I always believe that people have a good body shape is as important as have a good-looking face. People think working out is hard and boring; however I think when you see your six embs and pectoral muscles all the things which you do are worth it.</p>
 <p>One benifit is you can eat more food and does not need to worry about getting fat.</p>
<h3> <u> Cooking </u> </h3>

  <p>I like cooking. My favorite food is lasagna and vegetable is carrot. To keep body shape I usually eat chicken chest, blueberry, broccoli, milk, cereal and different kinds of nuts.</p>
  <p>I do different kinds of food. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Italian, American, Mexico, noodles and barbecue.</p>
  <p>I believe food shoud be tasty and look clean.</p>
<h3> <u> Pets </u> </h3>
  <p>I liked dogs in the past but I change my mind rn. Taking care a dog needs more time and patient. People should be responsible.</p>
  <p>Cats can take care of themselves. They are adorable. Everytime I look at their cute faces, I was cured.
<h3> <u> Musice </u> </h3>

  <p>I prefer R&B. Not only the songs have the strong rhythe are my type but I also like some slow song which shows their attitude and stories.</p>
<h3> <u> Fashion stuff </u> </h3>
  <p>For guys, I donot think make up is a good way. I prefer being naturely. Clean and confident are the key. Choosing a hair style and a color can boost yourself and find the dressing style fits to the yourself is super necessary. Remember donot too showy and do not dress like a kid.</p>
